You fucking whore.
Size and skill an advantage.
Gannicus.
Apologies, Dominus.
Speak, and see them set to task.
Gannicus
Harsh reward, for men already bearing your mark.
Yes, Dominus.
Gladiators!
Gnaeus!
We have borne witness to unfortunate events, removed from our hands.
The burdens placed upon us often overwhelm.
Come.
Duratius!
Begin!
Gannicus!
You are the victor.
Dagan.
Begin!
What fucking seizes you?
You drop guard, allowing Barca advantage.
Wake from it.
Eight men have yet to hold victory.
More so than Ashur.
Two men own equal victory.
Tullius?
True, Gannicus is trusted friend.
Only if you fall.
Crixus.
Begin!
Crixus, victor.
Enough!
Honor the boy.
You charge like a crazed goat, absent thought.
Words at last find way through thick skull.
Crixus.
You have done well with the man.
Crixus is undisciplined.
Gratitude, Doctore.
Close fucking mouth.
Oenomaus
He leaves presently.
Another stunt in the market?
Barca is to serve as such?
Ashur and Dagan?
Indus will never be champion.
Dominus.
Present yourselves!
Gladius!
What will be required of him?
Ashur and Dagan returned absent Indus.
And the Syrians?
The mark?
Your father would not approve.
Welcome to the fucking Brotherhood.
Why are we gathered?
Absent the test?
You may bear the mark, but do not think yourself a gladiator, you little cunt.
No, Doctore.
Gladius!
Bring fucking swords!
My wife.
Gratitude.
Permission for Spartacus.
Glaber's mercenaries punish absent cause.
With respect, every ludus requires the attention of its lanista.
You would see your family's heritage a thing of memory?
You would entrust the ludus to a slave?
Freedom.
Barca was not granted freedom.
And Ashur?
It was Spartacus that moved his hand.
He desires you at your best.
Had they but answered sooner.
Delay talk of freedom, until there are ears that would welcome the sound.
Place faith to closer quarters.
Together we shall restore honor to this ludus.
Rest and eat.
Crixus!
What is this madness?
He is a dog without honor!
In this very room?
Do not fucking speak.
Pathetic.
It bears only your treachery.
You received.
Your blood would dishonor the sands.
Ashur!
Is this not enough?
What is beneath your feet?
Answer!
Crixus!
Your tears.
Each time he enters the arena, he slips his cock into the mouth of the beast.
None of you stray dogs would last a fleeting moment.
This sad, battered Thracian stood against four in the arena.
Again and again and again!
The day was lost.
Gaze at this man!
And his victory in the arena?
The Thracian disagrees.
Crixus!
Practice swords.
Prove us wrong, Spartacus.
Pick it up.
Spartacus!
Your name -- your life -- is what we decide.
Pick it up.
Perhaps the coward requires advantage to still his trembling knees.
An attack must be grounded in proper footing.
Allow advantage to your back.
Become entangled with a more powerful opponent.
Hurl your sword in the arena.
Your foolishness cost a life.
Two fingers.
Bash his skull in.
One or two show promise.
Were there no better offerings?
Your will.
Keep pace!
Halt!
The day’s training begins shortly.
Kerza!
Pair with Spartacus.
Recruits!
Show the Thracian what we’ve learned in his absence.
Form two.
Spartacus!
Spartacus!
The Thracian is unpredictable.
Rod and lash fall unnoticed.
He is uncontrollable.
Barca!
Crixus!
The oath has been spoken.
Save blood for the fucking sands.
What seized fucking brain, releasing your swords in the arena?
Hubris.
Doctore.
Well earned.
Has Dominus spoken of my return?
You lower shield when you thrust.
Apologies.
Dominus.
Lesson one: never drop your fucking guard.
The coward finds his cock.
The market?
Gannicus.
Do the gods ever answer your prayers?
Dominus summoned me.
He has chosen him as champion, to face Vettius' man in the marketplace tomorrow.
Gannicus!
Lower voice!
Tomorrow you fight for the honor of this ludus.
Fall to your bed.
What are you doing?
Ever the fool.
Auctus speaks truth.
Your victory lifts the heart.
Switch!
Switch!
Switch!
Crixus!
Did you not hear the command?
The games of the Magistrate approach.
Perhaps not every man.
Save rations for men who deserve them.
Resume!
You send them to certain death.
Yet without victory.
Pietros!
You attack as you would a man.
You jostle and trip over the other like fools.
Pathetic.
Clean yourselves up.
You dishonor me.
No, you need the gods to descend and fight by your side!
Attend your eyes, then.
Let them drink deep the pain that awaits you.
My failure.
His first cut.
Yet these wounds are nothing.
By accomplishing both at once.
Show me the way to honor.
The hour of my glory is long past.
Spartacus!
You charge without thought.
You speak without thought as well.
Another weakness.
Spartacus
We are more!
Study.
But his legend was not birthed in the arena.
Attack!
Attend!
Batiatus has seen fit to fight twenty at this year’s Vulcanalia.
Our lowest shall fight at dawn.
One -- Thrust!
Spartacus!
Yet your training proves you worthy of neither.
Thrace.
On your knees!
The lands from which you hail matter no longer.
Never lose focus!
Two fingers.
You favor a different lesson?
Gather.
Crixus!
The unbeaten champion of Capua.
Ashur carries the remainder.
Barca!
Gladiators!
With respect, the public seeks an honorable fight.
Spartacus!
Now is not the hour for idle talk.
Tomorrow you step into the arena.
And yet it was there.
My spirit soars to see you again upon the sands.
Take note, you worthless fucks!
And you have been long absent.
You train?
By whose word?
Consider yourself fortunate.
Stand down!
Enough.
Half rations for the remainder of the week.
Guards!
The hour is late.
You should be in your cell.
Embrace the sands of time.
Spartacus bears but the title.
Perhaps next time thought will precede tongue.
Your form returns.
Your hour is upon you.
Re-form my words, in manner Dagan understands.
An honor you have not earned.
Your true test awaits you.
Remember your training.
See yourselves to the baths.
Gannicus.
We were as brothers once.
The men no longer accept me as a gladiator.
Gnaeus!
Your mastery of the sword falls to question.
You will do as commanded, absent complaint.
Return to training!
Raised there by words and touch of loving wife.
Pair with Barca.
Reward, for victory in the arena.
Tell him he earns twice your coin.
If you were not needed to exchange our words for his, you would never have been given chance to take up sword.
We dishonor this house.
The cause does not alter result.
See grin removed.
And win your life.
How does he fare?
It should not have happened.
Other matters occupy his attention.
It is you who forgets title of master and slave.
What of Spartacus?
You are to fight separately.
The decision has been made.
Embrace the pain.
Grant them a moment.
It is time.
Your will.
Gannicus
It is a great honor.
Did you note how he could scarce meet my eye?
He must now heed my commands, and does not embrace it.
For taking a life?
Barca.
Dominus.
In the arena.
Attend!
Pair up!
He shares my thoughts.
Have you lost fucking sense?
Your time has come.
Fight with honor.
The walls spread rumor of The Pits.
It is a place of pain and suffering, for the sake of pain and suffering.
Resume positions!
Study the flaws of your opponent.
The man is no base humor, to be laughed at.
Spartacus.
Batiatus summons you.
It is never an easy thing.
To see a friend once loved, now absent breath.
Every night breaks.
He fought with honor.
Varro left this world a gladiator.
Spoken as a true champion.
The games approach!
Spartacus!
Perhaps they will be appeased by suitable replacement.
There is but one.
Then it is time you reminded them who their true champion is.
Yours alone.
My actions only set you to the task.
There is no balance between us.
You misunderstand.
In the villa.
As are we all.
You smell of wine.
The sentiment is well received.
And now she returns.
And you?
Wise and understanding.
To find love such as this.
In memory.
Spartacus.
Discipline gives way to the moment.
As her people’s custom.
She would not wish it.
As a brother.
Dominus orders you prepared for transport.
What seizes Batiatus, to give you to Tullius after what he has done?
You wish this?
You would have better chance flinging yourself from the cliff.
It was a gift for Titus.
She would not have wanted this.
The Syrian arrives.
You will face Tasgetius and Synetos.
Our days have been filled with anguish and wounded heart.
Then fight for her.
Attend.
You have earned the rudis.
And victory.
The thought shall keep me warm.
Practice swords!
The fever grips him.
Whatever you wish.
He intended your freedom as well?
Ashur?
It would not cause notice.
The day’s training begins.
Spartacus!
Your wife’s passing.
As was your plan for escape.
Your victory over Theokoles.
Next time you seek escape.
Crixus.
You live.
You shall rejoin your brothers soon enough.
Have you not told him?
Far the opposite.
Barca left absent the boy.
The news found me also surprised.
You were there?
Regain your strength.
Enough!
What is this foolishness?
You knew Pietros well?
Yet you tend to his pets.
Born of a kind heart.
It surprises that Barca would claim freedom, yet leave the things he loved in captivity.
Did he speak to you of his plans for life outside the ludus?
Even as he left the gates?
Did he exchange words with Ashur?
He was present, was he not?
Surely if you set your mind to the task.
The fear in your eyes betray the lie on your tongue.
Remove yourselves.
Remain.
Barca.
With no thought towards Pietros?
It is a stirring sight.
Who else offered farewells?
Naevia claims to have escorted Barca to the gate.
Stories in conflict give me concern.
The auction begins, Dominus.
The Gaul Segovax demands expense.
Of little worth.
Dominus, with respect, your coin exceeds their value.
What is beneath your feet?
Spartacus!
Your tears.
Turn your eyes from your gods and fix them upon me.
Now, attend your master!
Remove your cloths!
To step upon the sands as a gladiator is the highest station a slave can pray for.
Segovax!
Attend!
Rhaskos.
